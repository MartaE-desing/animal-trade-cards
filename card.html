			<p>Tardigrades belong to an elite
				category of animals known as extremophiles,
				or critters that can survive environments that most others can't.
				For instance, tardigrades can go up to 30 years without food or water.
				They can also live at temperatures as cold as absolute zero or above boiling,
				 at pressures six times that of the oceanâ€™s deepest trenches,
				  and in the vacuum of space.
